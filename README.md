# Helpful-Links-Website

## User Story
As a bootcamp student,
I wanted the links and cheatsheets that are
placed in Slack to be on a webpage
so that I can easily find and read information based on the topic.

## Acceptance Criteria
-It is done when I have consolidated all the links from Slack onto the webpage.
-It is done when each link is valid and opens on a new page or tab.
-It is done when these links and cheatsheets are sorted by topic.
-It is done when the topics are separated visually by borders and it is easy to read and access.
-It is done when I have a navigation bar that links to the sections within the website.
-It is done when I have used a pseudoselector for the links that have been visited to change color.
-It is done when I have created a footer with my name.
-It is done when I have used the <span> element for text hovering.

## Description

This website was made to consolidate all of the helpful links and cheatsheets that have been put in Slack, organized by topic. I wanted to consolidate them all in a readable, accessible way that is easy to reference while also practicing what we have learned so far.

I will keep adding to it as needed.
